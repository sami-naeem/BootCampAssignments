Rob Advising 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Robo-Advising would complement the existing banking service offered by Monzo Bank. An investing offering, along with a banking offering, would make for a more holistic solution. This would align with the company’s goal of providing a one-stop shop. This service would also increase the AUM of the company, and allow the business to grow at a faster rate. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

-Machine Learning [7]


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Machine Learning is a core part of Robo advising. It's used to develop algorithms for risk analysis and asset allocation. Machine learning allows a Robo-advisor platform to scale at an exponential rate without the need for a significant increase in employee count as AUM increases, compared to a traditional investing firm.
